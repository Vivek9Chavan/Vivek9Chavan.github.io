## üìå Current Opportunities

### 1) AI-Driven Robotics for Disassembly by Learning from Human Demonstration
**Type:** Internship or Bachelor/Master Thesis (Berlin, on-site)  
**Focus:** Carry-forward of our egocentric research to robot policy learning for disassembly tasks (teleop/kinesthetic demos, action segmentation, policy learning, and evaluation on real hardware).  

**You‚Äôre a fit if you:**  
- Know Python + PyTorch, basic CV/ML, have ROS or robotics experience. 
- Can run experiments, keep logs, and write clearly  

**How to apply:** send a short note via **[Contact](/contact/)** _or_ message me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek9chavan/)** with:  
- 1-page CV (PDF)  
- Availability (start date, hours/week)  
- Links (GitHub/portfolio)

### 2) Video Understanding from Egocentric & Exocentric Perspectives for Industrial Scenarios
**Type:** Internship or Bachelor/Master Thesis (Berlin, on-site)  
**Focus:** Multiview video understanding in industrial workflows: activity recognition, temporal grounding, multi-modal fusion, continual learning under constraints.  

**You‚Äôre a fit if you:**  
- Comfortable with Python + PyTorch; prior CV coursework/projects
- Have an understanding of Vision-Language models (their strengths and weaknesses)
- Enjoy working with real-world datasets/pipelines and evaluating models rigorously

**How to apply:** use **[Contact](/contact/)** _or_ **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek9chavan/)** with the same materials as above.

## ‚úÖ General Notes
- Enrollment in a university program (BSc/MSc)  
- We value initiative, reproducibility, and clear writing  
- Visa/contract details depend on institute policy and role

If no roles are listed above (or no roles that suit you), feel free to **reach out anyway** with a short proposal (what you want to work on and why).
