### TL;DR
*   **The Scale:** We hit a breaking point. **21,575 submissions** (+61% from last year) and over 20,000 reviewers. The conference is now the size of a small city.
*   **The Shift:** The "Chatbot" era is ending; the **"Reasoning & Agents"** era has begun. The focus has moved from *what models know* to *how they think*.
*   **The Vibe:** Optimism mixed with "Data Anxiety." Everyone is excited about System 2 thinking, but nervous about where the next trillion tokens will come from.

    <p><strong>Reflecting on a week of ideas, conversations, and shared enthusiasm.</strong></p>

    <p>
      I just returned from San Diego after attending the NeurIPS conference last week. It was an amazing experience, though the sheer amount of information and activity was substantial. I took some time to reflect on everything I saw. This post summarizes the most important and noteworthy takeaways from my experience.

## Trends and Observations

The numbers defining NeurIPS 2025 are significant. There were 21,575 submissions, which represents a 61% increase over 2024. To put that in perspective, there were only about 9,400 submissions in 2020, meaning the field has more than doubled in five years. Despite the flood of papers, the acceptance rate remained steady at 24.5%, resulting in 5,290 accepted papers. To handle this volume, the organisers mobilised 20,518 reviewers. The peer-review process now requires a population larger than the seating capacity of Madison Square Garden.

The scale of the event was equally impressive in terms of attendance. There were roughly 29,000 total registrations. It is estimated that between 22,000 and 25,000 people attended in person in San Diego. This likely makes it the biggest academic gathering in history. The event was also diverse in its structure. In addition to the main algorithmic track, there were tracks for datasets and benchmarks, creative AI, position papers, and journals. This was all part of the main conference, which ran alongside workshops and other affinity events.

My personal observations matched these statistics. Walking through the hallways and listening to conversations, I frequently heard specific keywords. The most common terms were scale, reinforcement learning (RL), language models, world models, reasoning, and compute. These themes were reflected in the keynotes and poster sessions. The general trend holds that research based on Large Language Models (LLMs) dominated the conference and remains the prevailing direction for the AI community at large.


## Keynote Highlights

With six keynotes and the Test of Time award, it’s impossible to cover everything without writing a novel. However, two talks stood out to me as defining moments of the conference.

### Rich Sutton: The Bitter Lesson 2.0
Rich Sutton took the stage, and the room was dead silent. Known for his famous essay "The Bitter Lesson" (which argued that general methods that leverage computation eventually beat clever human design), everyone expected a victory lap.

Instead, he doubled down. He argued that we are still trying to hand-engineer too much "reasoning" into our systems. His thesis for 2025? **"Let the environment dictate the reasoning."** He pushed for a return to Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary driver for intelligence, suggesting that the "System 2" reasoning we are all excited about should emerge from RL training, not be hard-coded into architectures. It was controversial, provocative, and exactly what a keynote should be.

### Yejin Choi: The Limits of the Impossible
On the other end of the spectrum, Yejin Choi gave a grounding reality check. While Sutton spoke of infinite scaling, Choi spoke of **Common Sense**.

She highlighted the "Paradox of Knowledge": models can pass the Bar Exam but still struggle with basic physical causality that a three-year-old understands. Her slides were filled with hilarious (and worrying) examples of state-of-the-art models failing at trivial tasks. Her main takeaway? **"Reasoning is not just logic; it is world-modeling."** Until models have a coherent internal model of physics and causality, they will remain brilliant but brittle savants.

## Best Papers: Efficiency Over Scale

Every year, the "Best Paper" awards signal where the community’s values are shifting. If you expected the award to go to the largest model with the most zeros in its parameter count, you would be wrong.

### The Outstanding Paper Award
The top honor went to **Qiu et al.** for their work on **Dynamic Gating Mechanisms in Transformers**.

*   **The Gist:** Instead of activating the entire neural network for every single token, their method dynamically selects which "experts" or sub-networks are needed on the fly.
*   **Why it matters:** This is a direct response to the energy crisis in AI. We are running out of GPUs and electricity. This paper proves that the community is now prioritizing **inference efficiency** just as much as raw capability. It’s not sexy, but it’s the plumbing that will make AI sustainable.

### Test of Time Award: Faster R-CNN (2015)
The Test of Time award (given to a paper from 10 years ago) went to **Faster R-CNN** by Ren et al.
Seeing this on the big screen was a massive nostalgia trip. In 2015, drawing a bounding box around a cat was the cutting edge. Today, we are generating 3D video of cats playing pianos. It was a humbling reminder of how fast a decade moves in this field.

## Poster Presentations: The Real Conference

If the keynotes are the "concert," the poster sessions are the "mosh pit."

This is where the real work of NeurIPS happens. The setup was the usual endless maze of boards, but the crowd dynamics were fascinating this year.

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: -0.5em;">
  Lively and crowded poster sessions throughout the week.
</p>

### The "Hype Circles"
You could instantly tell which papers were trending on Twitter (X) by the crowd density.
*   **The "Reasoning" Crowd:** Any poster with "System 2," "Chain of Thought," or "O1-like" in the title had a crowd five people deep. I tried to get close to a poster about **"Recursive Self-Correction in Agents,"** but I honestly couldn't hear the presenter over the questions.
*   **The "Theory" Deserts:** In contrast, the pure theory sections (optimization bounds, convex analysis) were quieter. However, this is where I had my best conversation of the week. I spent twenty minutes talking to a PhD student about the **theoretical limits of in-context learning**. No hype, no buzzwords, just math. It was a breath of fresh air.

### My Personal Favorite Poster
I stumbled upon a paper regarding **"Small Language Models as Verifiers."**
The premise was simple: you don't need a massive model to *generate* the answer, but you can use a massive model to *check* the work of a smaller model. It felt like a practical, immediate solution to deployment costs that I can actually use in my work next week.

## The Expo: Where the Money Is

Walking from the poster hall to the Expo Hall felt like crossing a border between two different countries.

*   **The Poster Hall:** Academic, messy, poorly dressed, fueled by bad coffee.
*   **The Expo Hall:** Corporate, polished, aggressive, fueled by venture capital.

The Expo is where the sponsors flex. The booths this year were larger than ever, with NVIDIA, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI taking up massive real estate.

  Scenes from this year’s NeurIPS Expo.
</p>

### What I Noticed:
1.  **The "Full Stack" Pivot:** In previous years, companies were selling "Model APIs." This year, everyone was selling **"Enterprise Platforms."** The pitch has shifted from "Use our LLM" to "Build your entire Agentic Workflow on our secure infrastructure."
2.  **Robotics is Back:** There were robot dogs, humanoid arms folding laundry, and drones everywhere. With the rise of multimodal models (vision + language + action), robotics has finally found the "brain" it was missing for the last decade.
3.  **Recruiting Wars:** The swag was better this year, which usually means the recruiting is desperate. I saw companies handing out high-end mechanical keyboards just to get a resume scan.

Despite the flashiness, I found the Expo a bit exhausting. It’s a stark reminder that while the researchers upstairs are trying to solve AGI, the downstairs crowd is trying to figure out how to sell it to the Fortune 500.
